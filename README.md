Overview
The AdventureWorks data warehouse project aims to provide a structured approach to analyzing sales data using a snowflake schema. This model optimizes data organization and retrieval, making it easier to analyze complex relationships within the data.
Step 1: Understanding the AdventureWorks Database

    Familiarize yourself with the AdventureWorks database schema by reviewing schema diagrams and data dictionaries. This will help you understand the relationships between different tables.

Step 2: Identifying Fact and Dimension Tables

    Identify the primary fact table based on the sales process. For this project, the SalesOrderDetail table serves as the fact table.
    Determine the relevant dimension tables that provide descriptive information about the sales, such as:
        Customer
        Product
        ProductModel
        ProductCategory
        Address

Step 3: Creating the Snowflake Schema

    Start with the fact table and normalize the dimension tables to create a snowflake schema.
    For example, separate the Product dimension into distinct tables for Product, ProductModel, ProductCategory, and ProductSubcategory.

Step 4: Designing the Dimension Tables

    Create the dimension tables with appropriate columns and data types.
    Implement slowly changing dimensions (Type 2) to track historical changes in dimension attributes.

Step 5: Designing the Fact Table

    Create the fact table with necessary measures (e.g., Quantity, UnitPrice, TotalAmount) and foreign keys to the dimension tables.
    Ensure that the fact table captures all relevant metrics for sales analysis.

Step 6: Creating the Data Warehouse Database

    Create a new database for the data warehouse, such as AdventureWorksDW, to store the fact and dimension tables.

Step 7: Creating the Tables

    Create the dimension and fact tables in the data warehouse database according to the snowflake schema design.

Step 8: Loading Data into the Tables

    Extract data from the AdventureWorks database and load it into the data warehouse tables.
    Use ETL tools like SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) or other data migration tools for this process.

Step 9: Creating Indexes and Constraints

    Create appropriate indexes and constraints on the tables to optimize query performance and maintain data integrity.

Step 10: Testing and Validating the Data Warehouse

    Perform data validation checks to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data.
    Test the data warehouse by running sample queries and verifying the results against the source data.

Step 11: Data Validation with M Language

    Use M language in Power Query to validate the data, specifically for mobile numbers and email addresses:
        Mobile Number Validation: Implement logic to check if mobile numbers conform to a specific format.
        Email Address Validation: Use regex patterns to ensure email addresses are valid.

Step 12: Using DAX for Measures and Calculated Columns

    Utilize DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create measures and calculated columns in Power BI:
        Measures: Create key metrics such as total sales and average order value to facilitate dynamic reporting.
        Calculated Columns: Derive new insights from existing data, such as full names and other relevant attributes.
        Calculated Tables: Create summary tables for specific analyses, such as sales by month.

Step 13: Creating the Dashboard

    Use Power BI to create a visually appealing and interactive dashboard that summarizes key business insights.
    Incorporate various visualizations, such as:
        Bar charts to display total sales by product category.
        Line graphs to show sales trends over time.
        Tables to list customer details alongside their total purchases.
    Ensure that the dashboard allows for filtering and drilling down into specific data points for detailed analysis.
    Publish the dashboard to the Power BI service for sharing with stakeholders and decision-makers.
